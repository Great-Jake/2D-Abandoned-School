# 2D-Abandoned-School
**2D-Abandoned-School**
is the inaugural horror experience I have created, designed to immerse players in a chilling and suspenseful environment. Set within the desolate halls of a long-forgotten school, this 2D horror adventure challenges players to navigate through eerie classrooms, dark corridors, and unsettling spaces where danger lurks around every corner. Every detail has been carefully crafted to evoke a sense of tension, mystery, and anticipation, making each step forward an exploration into the unknown. With its haunting atmosphere, unsettling audio cues, and moments of psychological suspense, 2D-Abandoned-School aims to deliver an unforgettable horror experience that tests both courage and curiosity. This project represents my first attempt at combining storytelling, environmental design, and gameplay mechanics to create a uniquely immersive horror journey.

 **How do you code HTML, CSS, And Javascript?**
 Learning web development starts with three core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each has a distinct role in building websites and web applications. Here’s a structured approach to learning them effectively.

Step 1: **Understanding HTML** (HyperText Markup Language)

Purpose: HTML is the backbone of every web page. It defines the structure and content of your website, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, buttons, forms, and more.

Getting Started:

Learn basic tags:

<h1> to <h6> → Headings

<p> → Paragraphs

<a> → Links

<img> → Images

<ul> / <ol> → Lists

<div> / <span> → Containers

Practice building simple pages:

Make a personal webpage with a header, about section, and a list of hobbies.

Understand semantic HTML:

Tags like <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article> make your code more readable and accessible.

Step 2: Learning **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets)

Purpose: CSS controls the appearance of your HTML. It lets you style text, colors, layouts, and make your site visually appealing.

Getting Started:

Selectors and properties:

h1 { color: red; } → Changes heading color

p { font-size: 16px; } → Adjusts font size

Box model fundamentals:

margin, padding, border define spacing and layout

Positioning elements:

position: static | relative | absolute | fixed | sticky

Flexbox and Grid:

Modern layout systems for responsive design

Practice:

Style your HTML page with colors, fonts, and layout

Make a navigation bar, footer, and a simple grid layout

Step 3: Learning **JavaScript** (JS)

Purpose: JavaScript makes your web pages interactive. You can manipulate HTML, respond to user actions, and create dynamic content.

Getting Started:

Basic concepts:

Variables: let name = "Jake";

Data types: numbers, strings, arrays, objects

Operators: +, -, *, /, %

Control flow:

if, else if, else statements

Loops: for, while

Functions:

Reusable blocks of code:

function greet(name) {
  return "Hello " + name;
}


DOM Manipulation:

Change HTML dynamically:

document.getElementById("myText").innerText = "Hello World!";


Events:

React to user actions: onclick, onmouseover, onsubmit

Practice:

Create a to-do list

Make buttons that change text or colors

Build a small interactive game

Resources:

MDN JavaScript Guide

Step 4: Putting It All Together

Once you understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

Build small projects:

Personal portfolio page

Simple quiz game

Interactive calculator

Practice responsive design:

Learn media queries to make your website look good on phones and tablets

Use developer tools:

Chrome DevTools helps inspect HTML/CSS and debug JavaScript

Experiment often:

The more you try, the faster you’ll learn

Step 5: Advanced Tips

Learn CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap to speed up styling

Learn JavaScript libraries like jQuery or frameworks like React for advanced interactivity

Explore version control with Git and GitHub to save and share projects

Join coding communities (Reddit, StackOverflow, Discord) to ask questions and learn from others

Final Advice:
Start small, focus on one language at a time, and always practice by building real projects. HTML gives you structure, CSS gives you style, and JavaScript gives you life. Mastering all three is the key to becoming a skilled web developer.
