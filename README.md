# 2D-Abandoned-School
**2D-Abandoned-School** is the inaugural horror experience I have created, designed to immerse players in a chilling and suspenseful environment. Set within the desolate halls of a long-forgotten school, this 2D horror adventure challenges players to navigate through eerie classrooms, dark corridors, and unsettling spaces where danger lurks around every corner. Every detail has been carefully crafted to evoke a sense of tension, mystery, and anticipation, making each step forward an exploration into the unknown. With its haunting atmosphere, unsettling audio cues, and moments of psychological suspense, 2D-Abandoned-School aims to deliver an unforgettable horror experience that tests both courage and curiosity. This project represents my first attempt at combining storytelling, environmental design, and gameplay mechanics to create a uniquely immersive horror journey.
