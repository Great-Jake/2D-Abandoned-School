# 2D-Abandoned-School
2D-Abandoned-School

2D-Abandoned-School is the inaugural horror experience I created, designed to immerse players in a chilling and suspenseful environment. Set within the desolate halls of a long-forgotten school, this 2D horror adventure challenges players to navigate through eerie classrooms, dark corridors, and unsettling spaces where danger lurks around every corner.

Every detail has been carefully crafted to evoke a sense of tension, mystery, and anticipation, making each step forward an exploration into the unknown. With its haunting atmosphere, unsettling audio cues, and moments of psychological suspense, 2D-Abandoned-School delivers an unforgettable horror experience that tests both courage and curiosity. This project represents my first attempt at combining storytelling, environmental design, and gameplay mechanics to create a uniquely immersive horror journey.

Include a brief description of your game.

Share your game:

Make the repository public so others can play, or share the link with friends.

Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Learning web development starts with three core technologies. Each has a distinct role in building interactive websites and games.

Step 1: HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

Purpose: HTML defines the structure of your webpage.

Basics to Learn:

Headings: <h1> to <h6>

Paragraphs: <p>

Links: <a>

Images: <img>

Lists: <ul>, <ol>

Containers: <div>, <span>

Practice: Build a simple personal webpage with a header, about section, and hobbies list.

Step 2: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Purpose: CSS styles your HTML content, controlling colors, fonts, layouts, and more.

Basics to Learn:

Selectors and properties:

h1 { color: red; }
p { font-size: 16px; }


Box model: margin, padding, border

Positioning: static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky

Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts

Practice: Style your personal webpage, make a navigation bar, footer, or a grid layout.

Step 3: JavaScript (JS)

Purpose: JavaScript makes your site interactive and dynamic.

Basics to Learn:

Variables: let name = "Jake";

Data types: numbers, strings, arrays, objects

Control flow: if, else, for, while

Functions: reusable code blocks

function greet(name) {
  return "Hello " + name;
}


DOM Manipulation:

document.getElementById("myText").innerText = "Hello World!";


Events: onclick, onmouseover, onsubmit

Practice: Build small projects like a to-do list, interactive buttons, or mini-games.

Step 4: Putting It All Together

Build small projects like a portfolio page, quiz game, or calculator.

Learn responsive design with media queries.

Use Chrome DevTools to inspect and debug your code.

Experiment often—the more you practice, the faster you’ll learn.

Step 5: Advanced Tips

Learn CSS frameworks: Tailwind, Bootstrap

Learn JavaScript libraries and frameworks: jQuery, React

Use Git and GitHub for version control

Join coding communities: Reddit, StackOverflow, Discord

Final Advice:
Start small, focus on one language at a time, and practice by building real projects. HTML gives you structure, CSS gives you style, and JavaScript gives you life. Mastering all three is the key to becoming a skilled web developer.
